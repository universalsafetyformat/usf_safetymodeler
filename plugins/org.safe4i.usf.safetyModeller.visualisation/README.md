# USF Visualisation Project

## Project Overview
This eclipse plugin provides a Sirius design definition for USF Models which are based on the USF Meta Model. At the moment it supports two diagram types: Type Diagrams, Block Diagrams, and Safety Measure Diagrams. Those can be created by using the default Sirius functionality ("New->Representation File" in the context menu for emf models).
